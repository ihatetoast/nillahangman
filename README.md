# Bird, Beast, Fish
(A contemporary take on Bird, Beast, or Fish)

## What
The origin of Hangman is unknown, but there was a game called Bird, Beast, or Fish similar to Hangman. The rules were first published in a collection of games and songs by Alice Bertha Gomme: _The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland (Vol 2 of 2) With Tunes, Singing-Rhymes, and Methods of Playing According to the Variants Extant and Recorded in Different Parts of the Kingdom_. 

## How
As described by A. B. Gomme:
>This is a slate game, and two or more children play. One writes the initial and final letters of a bird’s, beast’s, or fish’s name, making crosses (×) instead of the intermediate letters of the word, stating whether the name is that of bird, beast, or fish. The other players must guess in turn what the name is. The first one who succeeds takes for himself the same number of marks as there are crosses in the word, and then writes the name of anything he chooses in the same manner. If the players are unsuccessful in guessing the name, the writer takes the number to his own score and writes another. The game is won when one player gains a certain number of marks previously decided upon as “game.” 

For this version, "Beast" will cover mammals, reptiles, and land arthropods, and "Fish" will cover true fish as well as other water-dwelling animals excluding water mammals. 

The original game says the user has 10 seconds. I believe a child's one-mississippi last longer than 1 second, so I, being such a sweet thing, am giving the user 20 seconds. Using setInterval instead of Date because kids' timing skills align more with funky browswers than the Date object. 



## Why
I've done Hangman many times, but this game seems like a nice challenge. Something different. Since the game is less familiar to me, the pseudo coding will be as much of a challenge as the Jabba Script, and I find that exciting.

And I like critters.

## Where (to define air, land, and water)
Air will be mostly birds, including the flightless, and bats. Water will be anything that mostly resides in water. For the sake of simplicity, amphibians will be in the water group, and reptiles that one mostly encounters (if one is unlucky) in water will be in that group, while others will be in the land group. My version; my rules. Turtles will be in the water group, but tortoises in the land.

## What I got from this
As I focus on learning different JavaScript frameworks and libraries, I do not want to forget that they are all JavaScript first. It also makes me appreciate the libraries such as ReactJS. 
I did not know how to play this game, so I was learning how to play it as I built this, which added a complexity I appreciate because I had no internal or written user stories to follow. This allowed the user (me) to be more of a stranger. I couldn't barge on because I have played the game thousands of times. (Yes, thousands. This ADHD child spent some time in detention).
